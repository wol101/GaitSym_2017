gaul-devel/util/README
======================

These files are only here temporarially, in order to allow GAUL to compile and
run.  They are basically included here to avoid unnecessary dependancies at
this stage of the development.  Further development of these files should not
occur in this CVS archive.  

For information, these files are required for these reasons:

                        functions.
