  ga_random_search()
  synopsis:	Performs a random search procedure by repeattedly
  		calling the seed and evaluation functions.
		The passed entity will have its data overwritten.  The
		remainder of the population will be let untouched.
		Note that it is safe to pass a NULL initial structure,
		in which case a random starting structure wil be
		generated, however the final solution will not be
		available to the caller in any obvious way.
  parameters:
